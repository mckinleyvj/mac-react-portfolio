            including but not limited to Accounting, Stock Inventory, HR, ERP, and POS. I've clocked years of providing support, managed and led hundreds of projects over the years that includes

            until a skilled work visa was granted early 2021. With this visa I am able to work full-time, therefore I've put my job hunting hat on and looked further into rebuilding my career.
            While on my job hunt, I've enrolled myself into a Full Stack Flex course hosted by Monash University. With my background knowledge in coding and applications analysis, I was able to cope with the 
            fast-paced learning environment.`

            and this has changed my life for the better. I got hired and now works as a Technical Business Analyst in an Agile Development team for a well-known organisation in Australia.
            I will strive to keep myself update to emerging technology and pursue continuing development.`
