# mac-react-portfolio

My react portfolio is the beginning of something big. It will serve as a portfolio generator for future jobseekers seeking to improve their online presence.

Ideas:

-   Register an account on the portal.
-   Have their own dashboard to manage their content.
-   Create their own unique portfolio based on data they've keyed in on a portfolio form.
-   Only able to generate portfolio when form is completed.

-   Portfolio will be displayed on a portal landing page. (Randomised)
-   Filtering and Sorting can be done.

Future Enhancements:

-   Employer registration and Job posting enabled.
-   Candidate enquiries and connection requests.
